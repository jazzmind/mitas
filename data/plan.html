<h4>Life cycle use case</h4>
<p>The persona for MIT On-Board is a 50-year-old MIT alumnus with deep technical expertise and prior P&amp;L responsibility, seeking to secure their first public company board position. This individual is likely to have a strong professional network but may lack specific connections to board opportunities. They may feel a sense of urgency to transition into board roles as they approach retirement or seek to leverage their experience in new ways. The journey begins when they recognize the need for a board position, often catalyzed by a desire for new challenges or to contribute to the governance of organizations in their field of expertise, particularly in AI, cybersecurity, and ESG. They may initially explore their options through informal discussions with peers or alumni networks, leading them to discover MIT On-Board through targeted outreach or word-of-mouth recommendations.</p>
<p>Once aware of the program, they analyze their options by comparing the offerings of MIT On-Board with other networking and educational programs, assessing factors such as the credibility of the program, the success of past participants, and the relevance of the curriculum to their goals. Upon deciding to participate, they acquire the product by registering online, likely paying through a credit card or alumni association membership benefits. The setup involves attending an orientation session, where they learn how to navigate the program and utilize its resources effectively. Throughout the program, they engage in networking events, workshops, and mentorship opportunities, deriving value from the connections made and the knowledge gained. They assess the value of the program by reflecting on the quality of their interactions and the tangible outcomes, such as securing interviews for board positions. If satisfied, they may choose to enroll in additional offerings or recommend the program to fellow alumni, thus creating a cycle of engagement and advocacy.</p>
<h3>Opportunity for Improvement</h3>
<p>An opportunity for improvement lies in enhancing the onboarding process and ongoing support for participants. Providing personalized mentorship and clearer pathways to board opportunities could significantly increase the perceived value of the program. Additionally, implementing a feedback mechanism to continuously refine the curriculum based on participant experiences would ensure that the program remains relevant and effective.</p>

<h3>How Your Proposed Minimum Viable Business Product (MVBP) Meets the Three Objectives of an MVBP</h3>





















<table><thead><tr><th>Objectives</th><th>How, specifically, does your MVBP meet this objective?</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Value</td><td>The MVBP provides value by offering tailored networking opportunities and educational resources specifically designed for MIT alumni with technical expertise. This includes workshops, mentorship from experienced board members, and access to exclusive networking events that align with their professional backgrounds in AI, cybersecurity, and ESG.</td></tr><tr><td>Pay</td><td>The economic buyer, which could be the alumni themselves or organizations looking to support their board placements, will likely pay a subscription fee for access to the program. Given the niche market, a fee of $500 to $1,000 for a comprehensive package of services could be justified based on the potential return on investment from securing board positions.</td></tr><tr><td>Feedback</td><td>The MVBP creates a meaningful feedback loop by incorporating regular surveys and feedback sessions after each event or workshop. This allows participants to share their experiences and suggest improvements, ensuring that the program evolves based on the needs and preferences of the alumni. Additionally, one-on-one follow-ups with participants will help gather qualitative insights.</td></tr></tbody></table>

The journey begins when they recognize the need for a board position, often catalyzed by a desire for new challenges or to contribute to the governance of organizations in their field of expertise, particularly in AI, cybersecurity, and ESG. They may initially explore their options through informal discussions with peers or alumni networks, leading them to discover MIT On-Board through targeted outreach or word-of-mouth recommendations. \n\nOnce aware of the program, they analyze their options by comparing the offerings of MIT On-Board with other networking and educational programs, assessing factors such as the credibility of the program, the success of past participants, and the relevance of the curriculum to their goals. Upon deciding to participate, they acquire the product by registering online, likely paying through a credit card or alumni association membership benefits. The setup involves attending an orientation session, where they learn how to navigate the program and utilize its resources effectively. Throughout the program, they engage in networking events, workshops, and mentorship opportunities, deriving value from the connections made and the knowledge gained. They assess the value of the program by reflecting on the quality of their interactions and the tangible outcomes, such as securing interviews for board positions. If satisfied, they may choose to enroll in additional offerings or recommend the program to fellow alumni, thus creating a cycle of engagement and advocacy.\n\n### Opportunity for Improvement\nAn opportunity for improvement lies in enhancing the onboarding process and ongoing support for participants. Providing personalized mentorship and clearer pathways to board opportunities could significantly increase the perceived value of the program. Additionally, implementing a feedback mechanism to continuously refine the curriculum based on participant experiences would ensure that the program remains relevant and effective.\n\n| Who is involved | When | Where | How |\n|----------------|------|-------|-----|\n| Persona | When they feel the need for a board position | At work or in social settings | Through self-reflection and discussions with peers |\n| Persona | During networking events | Alumni gatherings or online forums | By engaging with alumni networks and industry events |\n| Persona | When comparing options | Online or in-person | By researching and seeking testimonials from past participants |\n| Persona | Upon deciding to join | MIT On-Board website | By filling out a registration form and submitting payment |\n| Persona | At the time of payment | Online | Using credit card or alumni benefits |\n| Persona | At the start of the program | Orientation session | Attending an introductory meeting or webinar |\n| Persona | Throughout the program | Various program events | Participating in workshops, networking, and mentorship |\n| Persona | After program completion | Post-program reflection | Evaluating outcomes and connections made |\n| Persona | When considering further engagement | After initial program completion | By assessing satisfaction and outcomes |\n| Persona | After positive experiences | Social media or alumni networks | Sharing experiences and recommending the program to others |\n\nYou can Copy, Edit, and Save the results for this Step below.

What range do you feel comfortable with? | $5,100 | This is the cumulative present value of profits over five years, rounded for simplicity. |\n| Where do you feel the biggest unknowns are in your LTV estimation calculation? | Customer retention rates | The retention rates for recurring revenue streams are uncertain and can significantly impact LTV. |\n| Does the number seem reasonable? | Yes | Given the target market and the value provided, the LTV appears reasonable. |\n| What are the key drivers of the LTV if you want to increase it? | Increasing the one-time charge, enhancing the value of recurring services, and improving retention rates. | These factors directly influence revenue and profit margins. |\n| Where do you think you have the greatest opportunity to increase LTV all things considered? | Enhancing the value of recurring workshops and networking opportunities. | By providing more value, alumni may be more inclined to continue their engagement and repurchase.

Conduct interviews with MIT alumni who fit the target profile to assess interest in board positions. | Alumni are interested in securing board positions. | Access to alumni network, interview questions, scheduling tools. | At least 70% express interest in pursuing board positions. |\n| 2. Survey alumni to determine their perceived value of networking and educational programs. | Alumni believe networking and educational programs can help them secure board positions. | Survey platform, alumni contact list, survey design. | At least 60% agree that such programs would enhance their chances. |\n| 3. Analyze the success rate of similar programs offered to alumni from other institutions. | Similar programs have successfully helped alumni secure board positions. | Research on other programs, data analysis tools. | Evidence of at least a 50% success rate in alumni securing board positions. |\n| 4. Test the willingness to pay for the program through a pilot offering. | Alumni are willing to pay for a program that helps them secure board positions. | Pricing strategy, pilot program design, marketing materials. | At least 30% of participants in the pilot are willing to pay the proposed fee. |\n\n### Results from Testing Key Assumptions\n\n| What did you learn from the test? | Did the test validate your assumption? | What will you do as a result of this test? |\n|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| 1. Many alumni are interested in board positions, but some are unsure about the process. | Yes | Develop educational content to clarify the process of securing board positions. |\n| 2. Alumni see value in networking but are skeptical about the effectiveness of educational programs. | No | Consider enhancing the program's credibility by involving successful alumni as speakers or mentors. |\n| 3. Success rates of similar programs vary widely, indicating a need for tailored approaches. | Not Knowable At This Point | Conduct further research to identify best practices from successful programs. |\n| 4. Willingness to pay is lower than expected, indicating a need for a more compelling value proposition. | No | Reassess the program's offerings and consider introducing tiered pricing or free introductory sessions. |\n\nYou can Copy, Edit, and Save the results for this Step below - or update your Startup Idea at [MIT Orbit](https://orbit.mit.edu/disciplined-entrepreneurship) where you can also update the details for the idea to store critical information, such as Beachhead Market.\n#### Define MVBP\n### How Your Proposed Minimum Viable Business Product (MVBP) Meets the Three Objectives of an MVBP\n\n| Objectives | How, specifically, does your MVBP meet this objective? |\n|------------|-------------------------------------------------------|\n| Value      | The MVBP provides value by offering tailored networking opportunities and educational resources specifically designed for MIT alumni with technical expertise. This includes workshops, mentorship from experienced board members, and access to exclusive networking events that align with their professional backgrounds in AI, cybersecurity, and ESG. |\n| Pay        | The economic buyer, which could be the alumni themselves or organizations looking to support their board placements, will likely pay a subscription fee for access to the program. Given the niche market, a fee of $500 to $1,000 for a comprehensive package of services could be justified based on the potential return on investment from securing board positions. |\n| Feedback   | The MVBP creates a meaningful feedback loop by incorporating regular surveys and feedback sessions after each event or workshop. This allows participants to share their experiences and suggest improvements, ensuring that the program evolves based on the needs and preferences of the alumni. Additionally, one-on-one follow-ups with participants will help gather qualitative insights. |\n\n---\n\nYou can Copy, Edit, and Save the results for this Step below - or update your Startup Idea at [https://orbit.mit.edu/disciplined-entrepreneurship](https://orbit.mit.edu/disciplined-entrepreneurship) where you can also update the details for the idea to store critical information, such as Beachhead Market.\n#### Show dogs will eat dog food\n### Are Your \"Customers “Eating the Dog Food”?
